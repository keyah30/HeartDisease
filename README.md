## Heart Disease 

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting heart disease using machine learning models and data analysis techniques. The goal of this project is to provide insights into key factors influencing heart disease and to build predictive models for early detection.

#### Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualization of heart disease data.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.

#### Data

The dataset used in this project contains features commonly associated with heart disease, such as:
Age
Gender
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Resting Heart Rate

The dataset file is located at HeartDisease_Data.csv. Ensure proper data preprocessing before running the models to handle missing or inconsistent values.

#### Results

Key findings and insights, as well as the performance metrics of the predictive models, will be presented in the final report generated from the R Md file.
